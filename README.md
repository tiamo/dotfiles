# My personal dotfiles
This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my Mac.

You can install them by cloning the repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the install script.

```
git clone git@github.com:tiamo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```

The install script can be run by cd-ing into the `.dotfiles` directory and performing this command:

```bash
./install.sh
```
